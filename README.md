# Numbat SDK for JavaScript: Network Providers

Network Provider (API, Gateway) components (compatible with drtjs).

The default classes from this package should **only be used as a starting point**. As your dApp matures, make sure you **switch to using your own network provider**, tailored to your requirements (whether deriving from the default ones or writing a new one, from scratch) that directly interacts with the Numbat API (or Gateway). Regarding this, please see the documentation referenced below.
